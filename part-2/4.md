# Lorenz Attractor
The Lorenz attractor is an [attractor](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Attractor.html) that arises in a simpliﬁed system of equations describing the
two-dimensional ﬂow of ﬂuid. In the early 1960s, Lorenz accidentally discovered the chaotic
behavior of this system when he found that, for a simpliﬁed system, periodic solutions of the form
$$\begin{array}{c}
    {{\psi=\psi_{0}\sin\left(\frac{\pi a x}{H}\right)\sin\left(\frac{\pi z}{H}\right)}}
    \\\\
    {{\theta=\theta_{0}\cos\left(\frac{\pi a x}{H}\right)\sin\left(\frac{\pi z}{H}\right)}}
\end{array}$$
grew for Rayleigh numbers larger than the critical value, $Ra>Ra_c$. Furthermore, vastly different
results were obtained for very small changes in the initial values, representing one of the earliest
discoveries of the so-called 
[butterfly effect](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ButterflyEffect.html).

Lorenz obtained the simpliﬁed equations
$$\dot{X}=\sigma(Y-X)
\\\\\\
\dot{Y}=X(\rho-Z)-Y
\\\\\\
\dot{Z}=X Y-\beta Z$$
now known as the Lorenz equations.
